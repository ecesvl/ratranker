    RatRanker: Leveraging LLM-Generated Rationales to Enhance Passage Reranking
    <br />
  </p>
</div>

## About the Project
This project investigates the application of rationales generated by large language models (LLMs) for passage reranking, focusing on reducing reliance on proprietary models such as GPT-4.
By fine-tuning smaller models, including Flan-T5 (base and large) and T5-base, on rationales generated by GPT-4, the goal is to enable these models to effectively replicate rationale generation.

## Project Structure

* `src.augmentation` - This package handles the creation and management of rationales
* `src.evaluation` - Handles the evaluation process of reranking tasks
* `src.training` - Encapsulates the training logic for fine-tuning models
* `src.exaranker` - Based on the ExaRanker implementation https://github.com/unicamp-dl/ExaRanker
* `src.datasets` - Here the augmented training data is stored
* `src.utils` - Contains utility functions and shared resources for file management, path definitions, and auxiliary operations
* `src.scripts` - Contains standalone scripts
