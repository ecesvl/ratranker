text_metrics_evaluation folder contains the scripts for evaluating how well some 
of the text metrics like e.g. BERTScore, BLUE, ... are fitted for our text generation task.
Here we manually craft multiple quality levels of rationales and create manually also a ground truth. 
The ground truth is used as label and then for each levels the text metrics are calculated.
